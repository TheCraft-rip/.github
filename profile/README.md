# TheCraft.rip

TheCraft.rip is a newly relaunched Minecraft server dedicated to bringing back the classic player versus player (PVP) gamemodes. After being offline for a couple of years, TheCraft.rip has a new owner (Burnet01) and a new vision: to provide a balanced, engaging, and long-term gameplay environment for both new and veteran players. 

## For our community
This is your place for all things related to the server's future. Here, you can submit bug reports, suggest new features, discuss our development roadmap, and track our progress as we work to rebuild the server from the ground up. We're excited to hear your ideas. We also are hyped to collaborate with the community to make TheCraft.rip a place you'll be looking back at years in the future.
